there is two important line in the program 
 if ( !strcmp(v4, argv[1]) )
    execl("/bin/sh", "sh", 0);

we need the buffer and our input to be the same
the only way we can modifie the buffer is with this line

v4[atoi(argv[1])] = 0;

man atoi:
RETURN VALUE
       The converted value or 0 on error.
if argv[1] is empty/NULL we will have v4[0] = 0 and therefore having argv[1] == v4
